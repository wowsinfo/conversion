# Conversion
Convert old project from React Native to Flutter, Flutter to React Native and both to Kotlin. Using LLM magic, any programming language known to the model can be converted. However, don't expect the code to compile and manual adjustments will always be needed. The result may differ based on the LLM.

- See `convert/` for the source code
- See `llm_result/` for Flutter to React Native & React Native to Flutter conversion
- See `LegacyCodeConversion/` to have over 8,000 errors in Kotlin
